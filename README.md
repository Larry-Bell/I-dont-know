This code takes the name of the user and their age and concatenates them into a sentence. In order to use this code, the user simply inputs a name of a person and their age. If another contributer wanted to add more to this code, there are a multitude of possible additions. For example, someone could tweak the code so that the number of letters within a person's name is calculated when the string is entered. Or possibly going even further by calculating the number of vowels are within the name. This particular code is open to all desired contributors as well as open to any changes and/or enhancements.
